# Super-Weeb-Tunes

Welcome to the Github for the Super Weeb Tunes youtube playlist.

I created this repository because I got tired of songs getting deleted or set to private and not knowing what song I'd lost. Thank to  this list even if a song does get removed I can always just find a new version.

If you have any songs you'd like added to the playlist or want to provide a link to a higher quality version of one of the songs on the playlist that can be done through the issues tab. Make sure to assign yourself a tag when posting.

Youtube's shuffle feature is shit and will often change the order of the playlist If you select a different song from the list. This is problematic because sometimes it'll put you close to the end of the playlist without you realizing. To prevent this click shuffle and just listen to the song for the first one without skipping.
